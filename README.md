The dataset we will be examining is the original data from the article titled "Nonlinear Relationship between Serum Uric Acid Levels and Osteoporosis Risk: A Retrospective Study." It includes clinical baseline data and dual-energy X-ray measurement results. 
In this project, we will investigate the relationships between variables.

When we examine our dataset, we find variables such as gender, age, height, weight, BMI (body mass index), L1.L4 (bone density), CREA (creatinine), various vitamins, and laboratory terms listed in order.

On the data set, respectively;

•	Correlation matrix
•	Multiple Linear Regression
•	Create a model
•	Comparing AIC and BIC values
•	Distribution of residues
•	The problem of changing variance
•	Breusch-Pagan test
•	Detection of outliers by Cook Distance method
•	Model comparisons
•	Multiple connection problem
•	Model evaluation on the test set
•	Associated errors
•	Progressive Regression
•	Assumption checks   operations have been performed.
